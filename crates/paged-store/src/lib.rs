//! The native **Paged document codec** — (de)serialize a
//! [`paged_scene::Document`] to/from native `.paged` bytes with **no IDML**.
//!
//! This is the counterpart to the IDML import/export adapter: the adapter
//! converts `.idml` ↔ model, this codec persists the model itself. The raw-IDML
//! carry-through (`SourceArchive`'s byte blobs) is `#[serde(skip)]`, and the model's
//! derived caches are rebuilt via [`Document::rebuild_indexes`] after
//! deserialize — so a document reconstructs from native bytes with **no
//! `open_source_archive` / IDML parse** (N1, Approach A: the "self-owning model"
//! first slice).
//!
//! Format is JSON via `serde_json` for now (inspectable, wasm-clean, matching
//! the `document.pgd` precedent); a binary codec is a deferred optimization.
//! The on-disk shape mirrors today's IDML-derived model structure and **will
//! churn** as the model is reclaimed/renamed — treat pre-stabilization `.pgm`
//! parts as throwaway (version-gate before shipping to real documents).
